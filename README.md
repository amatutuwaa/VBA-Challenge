# VBA-Challenge: The VBA of Wall Street 

In this Challenge I use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
This Visual Basic script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  
  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change ((closing price at the end of that year) - (opening price at the beginning of the given year)).

  * The percent change ((closing price - opening price ) / opening price ) * 100 

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting was used to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

The script also summarises and returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
